Hydration in Next.js is the process of attaching event listeners and reactivating JavaScript logic on a Server-Side Rendered (SSR) or Static Site Generated (SSG) page once it reaches the client. When Next.js pre-renders a page on the server, it sends fully-formed HTML to the browser. However, this HTML is static and lacks interactivity until hydration kicks in, allowing React components to become interactive.

<br />
<br />
During hydration, Next.js reconciles the server-rendered HTML with the React
Virtual DOM. React then attaches event listeners and initializes component
states, ensuring that UI elements behave as expected. While this approach
enhances SEO and improves the initial page load speed, it introduces potential
issues like mismatched content (if the client-side React state differs from the
pre-rendered HTML) or performance delays due to JavaScript execution.
<br />
<br />
To optimize hydration, Next.js offers techniques like partial hydration and React
Server Components (RSC). Partial hydration allows selective hydration of components
instead of the entire page, reducing JavaScript execution on the client. React Server
Components, introduced in Next.js 13, further improve performance by keeping non-interactive
parts of a page on the server, eliminating unnecessary client-side JavaScript.
<br />
<br />
Developers can also defer hydration for specific components using Reactâ€™s
useEffect hook, ensuring that expensive calculations or state updates occur only
after the initial page load. Additionally, the suppressHydrationWarning
attribute can prevent hydration mismatches when rendering dynamic content that
differs between the server and client.
<br />
<br />
In summary, hydration is crucial for making SSR pages interactive in Next.js, but
optimizing it is essential to avoid performance bottlenecks. Techniques like partial
hydration, React Server Components, and strategic useEffect usage help improve the
user experience by balancing fast initial loads with seamless interactivity.
