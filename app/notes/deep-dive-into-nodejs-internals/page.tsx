        Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome&apos;s V8 engine,
        enabling high-performance execution of JavaScript outside the browser.
        What makes Node.js truly unique is its event-driven, non-blocking
        architecture, which relies on the event loop and libuv to handle
        asynchronous operations efficiently. Understanding how these components
        work together is key to mastering Node.js.
        <br />
        <br />
        At its core, Node.js uses the V8 engine, developed by Google, to compile
        JavaScript into highly optimized machine code. V8 provides the
        Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler, garbage collection, and other optimizations
        that make JavaScript execution fast. However, V8 alone does not handle
        I/O operations like file reading or network requests, which is where
        libuv comes in.
        <br />
        <br />
        libuv is a C++ library that provides an asynchronous, cross-platform I/O
        layer for Node.js. It manages tasks like file system access, networking,
        and timers using a thread pool. Since JavaScript is single-threaded,
        libuv delegates heavy tasks to worker threads and then notifies the main
        thread when they&apos;re complete. This is crucial for Node.js&apos;s
        non-blocking I/O model, allowing it to handle thousands of concurrent
        connections efficiently.
        <br />
        <br />
        The event loop is the core mechanism that enables Node.js&apos;s
        asynchronous behavior. It continuously checks for pending tasks and
        executes them in phases, including timers, I/O callbacks, and microtasks
        (like Promises). The event loop ensures that JavaScript code runs
        smoothly without blocking the main thread, making Node.js ideal for
        real-time applications like chat apps and streaming services.
        <br />
        <br />
        Overall, V8 powers JavaScript execution, libuv manages asynchronous
        operations, and the event loop coordinates everything. This synergy
        allows Node.js to be lightweight, fast, and highly scalable.
        Understanding these internals helps developers write more efficient
        applications, avoid performance bottlenecks, and fully leverage the
        power of Node.js.
