          I hold a bachelor&apos;s degree in computer science and have over two
          years of experience as a frontend developer at a startup. Iâ€™ve worked
          on projects like crowdfunding websites, e-commerce platforms, music
          streaming apps, and recommendation systems. I focus on creating
          attractive and interactive web apps, actively participating in
          discussions to enhance them, and collaborating closely with my team.
          My expertise enables me to build responsive, maintainable websites
          with optimized performance and seamless user experiences.
